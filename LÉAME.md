## GitHub Docs <!-- omit in toc -->


We use GitHub Discussions to talk about all sorts of topics related to documentation and this site. For example: if you'd like help troubleshooting a PR, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/github/docs/discussions).

#### And that's it!

That's how
